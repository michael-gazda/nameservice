# Query Types

## Queries

### Resolve
This takes a name and returns the value that is stored by the nameservice. This is similar to a DNS query.

### WhoIs
This takes a name and returns the price, value, and owner of the name. Used for figuring out how much names cost when you want to buy them.

### Name
This does not take a parameter, it returns all the names stored in the nameservice store.
